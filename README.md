# image_scraper


The purpose of this program is to facilitate the collection of image datasets. Simply specify what and how many images you would like to gather, and the program will retrieve them for you using Google Images. Once the image collection is complete, it will display them one by one, and all you have to do is press any key to save the respective image to the specified folder. Pressing the Escape key allows you to skip an image.

Make sure you are using the appropriate driver for your version of Chrome.
